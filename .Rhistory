# This graph shows the age distribution of medal winning athletes from Top 5 medal winner countries. We can see the PRC has the highest number of athletes between 20-35, which is the age that people has the best physical condition. For the medal winners over age 50, the athletes come from the US, China and UK. It might prove the technology and training level of the athletes from those country, so that they can maintain a higher competition level.

# This graph shows the ranking of Top 5 medal winning countries. Compared to the number of athletes, we can see that four out of five countries are within the top 10 number of athletes attending the Olympic games. The only exception ins ROC, which might due to the sanction on Russia. But the overall pattern is those countries with more athletes will win more medals in the game.
